## 🌟 What You’ll Discover

By taking this course, you will not just **learn** about AI agents—you will **build them**, **test them**, and **see them come to life** in real-world applications.  

Here’s a glimpse of what’s waiting for you:

- **Foundations of Agentic AI** – Understand what makes agents autonomous and how they interact with their environment.  
- **LLMs as Reasoning Engines** – Harness the power of modern language models for decision-making, reasoning, and planning.  
- **Tool Use & API Integration** – Enable agents to interact with real-world systems, from executing code to controlling APIs.  
- **Memory & Knowledge Retrieval** – Give your agents long-term memory with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).  
- **Multi-Agent Systems** – Explore the magic of collaboration between agents, where they strategize, communicate, and solve problems together.  
- **Agents for Code, Data, and Robotics** – Deploy agents for software development, research automation, and even embodied AI in robotics.  
- **Ethics & Safety** – Tackle the crucial questions: How do we align agents with human goals? How do we make them safe, reliable, and trustworthy?
